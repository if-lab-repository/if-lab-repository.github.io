                            <p>
                            This workshop will invite speakers and participants from all the research thrusts. Mixing both physical and virtual participation, this workshop will provide adequate travel supports and comprehensive online streaming access.
                            During the speaker invitation process, the organizing committee will also give a high priority to members in underrepresented groups. Travel support will be granted to presenters and participants who may not have adequate support from their educational institution and those underrepresented groups in the fields related to the workshop.
                            </p>
                            <h2>In-Person Participation</h2>
                            <h1>Application Selection Criteria</h1>
                            <p>Researchers applying for attending the workshop (except for the invited talks) will be selected for funding based on the following (ranked) criteria:<i>
                            1. Presenters at the workshop.
                            2. Lack of any available travel support.
                            3. Membership in an underrepresented group.
                            </i>
                            During the speaker invitation process, the organizing committee will also give a high priority to members in underrepresented groups. One of the four thrust leaders is a female researcher, Sharon Hu from Notre Dame. Our goal is to ensure at least 20% of the speakers are in an underrepresented group. 
                            </p>
                            <h1>Travel Grant</h1>
                            <p>We will provide travel support for about 25 U.S.-based researchers (averaging $500 to $1,500 each). 
                            The majority of the awards will be granted to the invited speakers and participants that have no or limited financial support whatsoever. Priority will be granted to US citizens and permanent residents as well as the researchers from underrepresented groups. As we solicit applications for travel support to PIMT, we will specifically encourage underrepresented groups of researchers to apply. The availability of travel support will be announced through the workshop website soon after the official acceptance of this proposal. 
                            </p>

                            <h1><strike>White Paper Submission</strike></h1>
                            <p> The speakers will be invited by the thrust leaders of each thrust while other participants will be selected from the solicited white paper submissions or invited by the organizing committee. Please submit your white paper in the <a href="https://forms.gle/qerRK1LveQpU3LyQ7"> <u>application page</u></a>.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Reporting</h1>
                            <p>Researchers that are supported by this grant for attending the workshop will be required to submit a summary of their experience at or right after the workshop. A summary of these experiences will be included in the final report. 
                            </p>
                        
                            <h2>Online Participation</h2>
                            <p>The workshop will be held late this year at GMU and the organization team is carefully monitoring the situation of COVID-19. Due to certain COVID-19 travel restriction, we also provide comprehensive online access to the workshop. Participants who may not able to attend the physical workshop can stream the invited talks and join the group discussion.

                            <p> Applicants should clarify the online participation option during the online application process, and will receive particular online participation instruction later. Please continue to check our website for updates.</p>
